# LinkedIn-automated-job-applications

A bot to automatically apply to jobs on LinkedIn.

The program opens Google Chrome and signs into LinkedIn.
The type of jobs to be applied to can be changed by altering the URL in the Python file. The URL should be the URL obtained when searching for the correct job type on LinkedIn.
The program then applies for all jobs on the page, as long as they are 'Easy Apply' jobs.
